# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This repo contains the content for module 13

- I wanted to create a back end tool that would help an e-commerce company compete with other companies in the industry.
- The application can take a user's inputs in insomnia and save them to a server.
- I learned more about about routes, models, and how to use Insomnia.

## Installation

- Get SSH key from https://github.com/Luwylbab/E-Commerce-Back-End

- Clone the repository using [git@github.com:Luwylbab/E-Commerce-Back-End.git]

## Usage

When a user connects to the databse using Sequelize and runs the node command in the terminal, a server will be created. The user can then open the API GET routes in Insomnia and is free to view, add, update, and delete data in the database.
